For using this calculator you have to run the script by typing the following command:

Here are some rules on how to use this calculator(some are very basic as that of simple calculator you have used in your life):
  
   For computing any expression first type the expression using buttons in the calculator and after that press (=) for getting the output.
  
   Let's say you have calculated some expression and you got an ans x.
   
   After that two scenarios are possible:
      
     1)You have to use x without any modification in your next computation:
         for that simply press symbol you have to use with x after the x and complete your expression
         
     2)You want to compute an expression which doesn't use x:
          Than you don't have to delete x by using AC or del button
          You just have to start typing your next expression as soon as you type your first character
          x will automatically disappears from the screen and you get your first character typed,
          complete your expression and get the result
